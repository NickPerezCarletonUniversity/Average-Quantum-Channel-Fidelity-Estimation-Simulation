# Average-Quantum-Channel-Fidelity-Estimation-Simulation
A simulation of estimating a quantum channel's average fidelity, using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Code by Nicolas Perez.

MIT license. Much appreciated if: credit is given to Nicolas Perez, a reference to the "A Framework for Authenticity, Integrity and Replay Protection in QuantumData Communication" paper is made explicit, and credit is given to all of the authors of the paper. 

The code in the jupyter notebook is for the replay detection simulation in the "A Framework for Authenticity, Integrity and Replay Protection in QuantumData Communication" paper. To get the same results as seen in the paper, the variable 'num_trials' must be set to 10000 in the last cell of the notebook. Last tested using Python 3.9.1.
